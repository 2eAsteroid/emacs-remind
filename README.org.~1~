* emacs-remind.el 1.0.0
** What?
A small notification system that sends a desktop notification, and creates a temporary buffer.
** Why?
I had to make a notification system.
** Where?
It can be used anytime you want to send a notification.
** How?
It accepts two arguments, the REMINDER and the PARENT.
The REMINDER is the content of the message that you want to send, and the PARENT is the application / source of that message.
It creates a temporary buffer with src_emacs-lisp[]{(with-output-to-temp-buffer PARENT)}, and prints the message using the function src_emacs-lisp[]{(princ)}, along with a timestamp and a message stating the source of that message. It then uses the function src_emacs-lisp[]{(alert-toast-notify)}, to send a desktop notification.
